# Lucene Search Engine 

## Description

Lucene Search Engine is an application based on Java's open-source search software Lucene, which provides
capabilities such as index creation and query execution. These operations are combined to create a search
engine that uses user-input keywords to search on a collection of songs that consists of three fields: artist,
song and lyrics. The search can be performed to be executed based on all fields or one specific. The results 
are presented based on their relevance (ranking) to the query and are visualized in a graphical user interface
using the JavaFX library. The application also features functions such as keeping search history to similar
searches as the user types and sorting alphabetically the results after the search, based on one of the fields.
