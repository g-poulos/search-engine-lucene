Grateful Dead,Ramble On Rose,/g/grateful+dead/ramble+on+rose_20062373.html,"Just like jack the ripper, just like mojo hand,  
Just like billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band,  
Just like New York city, just like Jericho,  
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?  
Ramble on baby, settle down easy  
Ramble on rose.  
  
Just like Jack and Jill, mama told the jailer  
One hear up, and one cool down, leave nothin' for the tailor.  
Just like Jack and Jill, papa told the jailer  
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?  
Ramble on baby, settle down easy  
Ramble on rose.  
  
I'm gonna to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime,  
I know this song it ain't never gonna end.  
I'm gonna march you up and down along the county line,  
Take you to the leader of a band.  
  
Just like crazy Otto, just like wolfman jack,  
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back.  
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein,  
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?

Ramble on rose.  
  
I'm gonna to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime,

Take you to the leader of a band.  
  
Good-bye mama and papa  
Good-bye Jack and Jill  
The grass ain't greener  
The wine ain't sweeter  
Either side of the hill.  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?  
Ramble on baby, settle down easy  
Ramble on rose.

I'm not your slave  
I'm not your mother  
I'm not your maid  
I mean I've got a life too  
So fuck you!  
  
Why can't you be nicer to my friend?  
They're gonna be here soon  
Last time they were here  
You just sat in the bedroom  
Friday you went out with your fat friend Lou  
Fuck you!  
  
Why don't you ever ask about my Chinese cooking class?  
I only took it 'cause you like moo shu  
Fuck you!  
  
I'm sorry honey, about the way I've been acting lately  
Fuck you!  
  
Don't be like that, we'll visit your mom when I get some time off  
Fuck you!  
  
I had the beer at work, for God's sake  
Fuck you!  
  
By the way, would it be cool to go golfing tomorrow?  
Fuck you!  
  
I was just kidding, I want to hang out with you  
Why don't you ever take me to a play?  
Or a museum?  
There's an art gallery two blocks away  
And we've never been there  
We always do what you want to do  
Fuck you!  
  
You didn't notice  
I got new throw pillows for the sofa  
You didn't notice I had the kitched painted blue  
Why don't you notice all those guys looking at me?  
You take me for granted  
Do you know there's a guy at work that always asks me out to lunch?  
I always try to look my best and you should too  
Fuck you!  
  
Why won't I ever get out of this relationship?  
You're such a jerk  
The only thing you do right is  
Tell me that you love me  
Well, I guess I love you too  
But fuck you!  
Seriously

Marillion,Torch Song,/m/marillion/torch+song_20088848.html,"Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now  
Something about roman candles fizzing out, shine a little light on me now  
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation, alcohol can thrill me now  
It's getting late in the game to show any pride or shame  
I just burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now  
  
Doctor says my liver looks like leaving with my lover, need another time-out
now  
Like any sort of hero turning down to zero still standing out in any crowd  
  
Pulling seventeen with experience and dreams, sweating out a happy hour  
Where you're hiding 29 you know it ain't a crime  
To burn a little brighter now, burn a little brighter now  
  
Dr. Finlay: ""And my advice is if you maintain this lifestyle  
you won't reach 30""  
  
Torch: ""Christ - it's a romantic way to go really, it's part  
of the heritage, it's your round i'n'it?""  
  
We burn a little brighter now  
  
Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now  
It was something about roman candles fizzing out, shine a little light on me

Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation, alcohol thrill me now  
Getting late in the game to show any pride or shame  
Burn a little brighter now, we burn a little brighter now  
We burn a little brighter now

Oscar Hammerstein,You'll Never Walk Alone,/o/oscar+hammerstein/youll+never+walk+alone_20907459.html,"(Nettie)

Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky  
And the sweet, silver song of the lark  
  
(Chorus sings with Nettie)  
  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone

Living a sunshine  
And a cloudy sky can lead to a rainbow

[Chorus:]  
If you're lucky to find a special man  
You gotta love him all you can  
And anything he wants from you  
Should be the least that you can do  
Don't let him down  
Just give him love  
Don't let his dreams turn into dust  
He's only tryin' to build a wonderland for two  
If you're the one to share his world  
Just be the someone he can trust  
For the sake of love  
For the love of love  
For pete's sake  
Don't let him down  
Don't let him down  
  
You can live in a castle  
And dream of your diamonds  
Thinkin' you really walk tall  
But livin' and dreamin' when you're alone  
Ain't livin' or dreamin' at all

For what a Christmas to have the blues  
My baby's gone and I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
  
Oh, crowds will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night  
  
Friends and relations, send salutations  
As sure as the stars shine above  
Yes it's Christmas, Christmas my dear  
It's the time of the year, time of the year  
To be with the one you, the one you really love  
  
Oh won't you tell me, we'll never grow old  
  
Christmas and New Years will find you home  
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain  
Because I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again  
  
Please come home for Christmas baby  
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain  
Because I'll be happy, Lord I'll be so happy

Frank Sinatra,Don't Fence Me In,/f/frank+sinatra/dont+fence+me+in_20055814.html,"Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above, don't fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love, don't fence me in.  
Oh let me be by myself in the evening breeze,  
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees,  
Send me off forever but I ask you please, don't fence me in.  
  
Just turn me loose and I'll straddle on my saddle underneath the western
skies.  
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise.  
Oh let me ride to the ridge where the west commences,  
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses,  
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences, don't fence me in.

Train,All American Girl,/t/train/all+american+girl_10235608.html,"To be that good, it must be taxin'  
No such thing as satisfaction  
You're makin' things happen while I'm relaxin'  
Like a Sunday afternoon  
My dad used to tell me I was lazy  
I got dance moves like Patrick Swayze  
I'm the left over turkey for the world's mayonnaise  
The star next to the moon  
  
Now I know I'm just here to amuse you  
And I don't mean to abuse you  
But if I could just use you one time  
  
Tell me what it's like  
To be the queen of it all  
The Neiman Marcus of the Mall  
And tell me what it's like to be the one and only  
All American Girl  
  
Now I never had a supernatural feelin'  
Not to mention a sexual healin'  
But every now and then I get to the kneelin'  
To thank him for it all  
But you probably got some inside connection  
So many numbers that you gotta rolodex them  
So much muscle that you never gotta flex them  
To catch you when you fall  
  
And I know I'm just here to amuse you  
And I don't mean to confuse you  
But if I could just use you one more time  
  
Tell me what it's like to be the house on the hill  
The number one diet pill  
And tell me what it's like to be the one and only  
All American Girl  
  
Now I bet you won't say you get crazy  
Or that you don't shave your legs  
When you're lazy  
Or that you're just like everybody else in the world  
You just got lucky, that's all  
  
And I know you're not here to amuse me  
But you sure know how to confuse me  
So if I could just ask you once again  
  
To tell me what it's like to be a star on the rise  
A breakfast cereal prize  
And tell me what it's like to be the one and only  
All American Girl  
The All American Girl  
The all amazing crazy girl

In the zanniest of directions  
My love protection, my love erection  
You better get some of my infection

My love is gettin' my food  
My love, my love  
  
My love began from love  
My love for an unknown grubby bum  
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb  
My love for the best set of buns  
My love for the feel of the drums  
My love for a butter knuckle hands  
My love for the swedes in the bad  
My love for the legs that I spin  
My love for the fat mingy  
My love, my love  
My love is my gross inner self  
My love is my dick in my head  
My love is my gross inner self

Maroon 5,Until You're Over Me,/m/maroon+5/until+youre+over+me_20600253.html,"This relationship is over,  
Though my stomach still hurts.  
And now I'm gonna live alone,  
Why is the pain much worse?  
You're so much better without makeup,  
Why would you hide your face?  
Don't want to spend the night and wake up,  
Realize I've made a big mistake.  
  
[Chorus]  
I can not refuse your eyes,  
Please don't look at me tonight.  
My heart beats fast I know you're there,  
And I pretend like I don't care.  
It hurts so bad to know the truth,  
But I am still in love with you.  
  
I never meant to keep you waiting,  
And now your food is getting cold,  
I keep denying I'm in love with you,  
My routine is getting old.  
And now you stand in front of the table,  
And say you never look back.  
Your super stupid when you're angry,  
You only wake up sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It hurts too much to know the truth,  
But I am still in love with you.  
  
No more kisses on your lips, tender touch oh please,  
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.  
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be  
And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me.  
  
I can not refuse your eyes,  
Please don't look at me tonight.  
My heart beats fast I know you're there,  
And I pretend like I don't care.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It hurts too much to know the truth,  
But I am still in love with you.

Then home's where the heart is  
How we ever gonna get back where we started  
From now on, run with blindfolds  
Into the woods till the trees knock us out cold  
Winds shriek like drunken females  
On a hen night, last bit of fun,  
Till he breaks her heart in a text or an email  
She can deal with the bastard son  
  
We've got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road  
We see a light in the dark but it's fading like hope  
I'll make a promise just to break it for the sake of it  
We think that we're honest but truth is what we make it to be  
  
Well a stitch in time saves nine, that's fine  
But we've all been proper stitched up this time  
It's a right old mess at a grand old time  
Right and left, in front and behind  
It's Sunday, Sunday, another bloody Sunday  
Just a day till another bloody Monday  
Morning, yawning, boring, snoring  
In front of the boss when you just got a warning  
  
We've got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road  
We see a light in the dark but it's fading like hope  
I'll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me  
Just so there's someone else to blame when it all falls down  
When it all falls down, down, down  
When it all falls down, down  
  
So let's get some fire in our hearts,  
And a yellow brick road  
I'm getting bored of the dark,  
We could turn the lights on, you know  
I'll make a promise and I'll keep it for the sake of it  
We could tell the truth for once, see just how we take to it  
We could walk in forests and climb up every tree  
We'll build our house upon the sand, every day in the sea  
I'll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me  
Just so there's somebody else  
Just so there's somebody else  
Just so there's somebody else

You could be respectable and keep it to yourself,  
Cause we know that she was the best that you've had.  
Yes I know, she was the best that you've had.  
Greased and unclean,  
A hiss laid by God.  
A duped bridle hole,  
And a boyhood slipping in Blood.  
You can say it's nothing,  
You can claim there's no-one to hide.

Like a drunken guillotine  
Lingering just above my head  
Why, why, why, why?  
Why was I born ""The Nine""  
Cursed repeatedly  
Who would know if I should die.  
  
No one needed me  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
Cold and silent was the house my name was on  
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one  
  
S'dark and empty was the place to which I'd come  
All at once my bones began to change  
I was tall and young again,  
Sweet as rain falling on the snow  
Who, who, who, who?  
Who is he, who am I, and  
What laid in between?  
  
How can I say goodbye? No one let me in  
Can't see no need for Nine no more  
Now it's too late to open the door.

Paying tax and and doing stir

Music's food 'til the art-biz folds

But tomorrow's fair game,  
For a life that's fit for living

Funerals, fear and the war ain't won  
Paddy's just a figure of fun

And he eyes his gun like a rich man's toy  
He's killing more than celtic joy

It's a loud sweet voice and it won't give way

You can hear the song of democracy  
The echo of eternity  
With a Rak-a-Rak-a feel.

From the Tyne to where to the Thames does flow  
My English brothers and sisters know  
It's not a case of where you go  
It's race and creed and colour.  
From the police cell to the deep dark grave  
On the underground's just a stop away  
Don't be too black, don't be too gay  
Just get a little duller.  
  
But in this green and pleasant land,  
Where I make my home, I make my stand  
Make it cool just to be a man,  
A uniform's a traitor.  
Love is international  
And if you stand or if you fall,  
Just let them know you gave your all,  
Worry about it later.

Very polite to you  
But I remembered you  
Friday nights 1969  
ATV - you murdered every line  
Too old to be a child star  
Too young to take leads  
Four seasons passed  
And they axed you  
Nervous juvenile  
(Won't smile! )  
What became of you?  
Did that swift eclipse torture you?  
A star at eighteen  
And then-suddenly gone  
Down to a few lines  
In the back page of a faded annual  
Oh but I remembered you

And all the tears  
All the lies  
All the waste  
I've been trying to make it change  
And now my eyes are open

I need your time  
When everything's wrong  
You make it right  
I feel so high  
I come alive  
I need to be free

Kate Bush,Where Are The Lionhearts,/k/kate+bush/where+are+the+lionhearts_20622735.html,"Destiny took me in her arms and told me:  
""You're a little lost on the fall.  
You fall for all the men  
You shouldn't fall for all at all. ""  
Ooh, I know she knows, but still I go on,  
Well, I'm a fool.  
  
Climbing up the ladders  
To slide down the adders  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks...  
  
Joan of Arc walks into my mirror,  
A burning sword.  
I'd like to cry.  
I look into her eyes.  
I see she's seen the long days and night.  
""Ooh,"" she says,  
""The games are still the same, I see,  
But they've changed the names now.  
Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart? ""  
  
Lionhearts in the asylums,  
Lionhearts tossed at sea,  
Lionhearts who've lived their lives, like Arthur.  
Lionhearts in cathedrals,  
Lionhearts at mournings,  
Lionhearts in every seed  
But they're sown  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks...  
  
Somebody I couldn't see  
Tied me up and put me away,  
Here on the rocks,  
Here on the rocks,

Quietdrive,Rise From The Ashes,/q/quietdrive/rise+from+the+ashes_20705324.html,"I felt this way before  
I fell right through the floor  
And I am certain I've become  
Broken, bruised, and numb  
Would you restate your opinion  
And hold back your investigation  
Do you see the sins you're making  
Cause I've made them all before  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
And my only hope  
Is falling down  
  
And by my own admission  
You'll find that my condition  
Is worse than you imagined  
You're better off if you know  
But every time before that I  
Tried to measure pain inside  
You can't ignore it  
Right now I can't ignore it  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
  
Inside of me (x7)  
I'll take my heart  
And rip my feelings out  
Before they make me doubt  
And I'll fall down with flames burning  
Alive again  
As long as you know that  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
Finish me

Dark eyes see right through me and I just can't hide  
You drive me crazy with what you don't say and the way you hold back love  
Tell me tell me won't you please please tell me  
Need an answer from above  
There you are, You're my desire, and here I am  
I'd be a liar if I said  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't gonna crawl  
You ain't gonna nail my heart to the wall  
You ain't gonna find me crying like a child just asking for it all  
I ain't gonna beg, I'd rather lose it all instead  
If that is what it takes to get you Part of me just might let you  
For someone like you, I'd do more than fall  
I just might crawl  
  
Seems like I get this feelin' this time of night  
Head down senses reeling, something just ain't right  
Imagination locked up inside and it's got nowhere to go  
I see my lover through anothers eyes  
And it's killing me to know the truth  
Like playing with fire To lose you

James Taylor,Fading Away,/j/james+taylor/fading+away_20069337.html,"When I've got something to say,  
Well, don't I always let you know?  
So that you and I can go my way together.  
And if I get carried away,  
Well, I could be sailing on a song  
And maybe we could carry on forever.  
But lately this old dog has been chasing his tail  
Round and round and round.  
And the circles in my mind,  
They have been winding slowly down.  
Everybody's breezing up but I'm seizing up,  
I'm freezing up and I'm fading away.  
I've got a hold on a night in June,  
I've got room for you and me.  
I've got moonlight up in the trees,  
I've got sixty-eight degrees.  
I've got nothing on my mind  
But I've got loving in my heart,  
And I've got something out in the garden  
I want to show you.  
Well, it really doesn't matter after all  
If we quit this round about  
And no one will really notice  
If we can just sit this next one out.  
  
You can strike up the band without me,  
You may have your doubts about me,  
But I'm just fading away.  
You can hardly even see me  
Because I'm fading away.  
Well, it's hard to find a label  
For this feeling in my bones.  
That this is all a make-believe  
But my cards are on the table  
And there ain't nothing up my sleeve.  
  
And here I thought I was a thinking man  
But I'm a shrinking man, I'm sinking man,  
I'm fading, fading away.  
Well, it's really not so bad  
To be fading away.  
Come on along with me  
And we'll go fading away.  
You can hardly even hear me  
Because I'm fading away.

Like a tunnel to the sea  
  
And I who went to sleep as two  
Woke up as one now only you remain

To the time when the light went fading fast

You're never ready  
That's why they call it?  
The Rush  
  
Tell me, are you there?  
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer  
See, I've prayed for peace and love  
Like so many of us do  
Then I prayed to find someone like you  
Up in the morning  
Fell out of my bed  
Worn out, I couldn't sleep  
Thoughts of you filled my head  
How could it be?  
This is scaring me  
  
Seems every time I try  
To rest my heart is when  
The rush is back again  
Maybe this time I'll  
Make it work somehow  
Guess I'm gonna find out now  
  
I get a rush  
And it's love for sure  
What else can it be  
Something beckons me  
And I go back for more  
Ooo such a rush  
Can't pass love by  
What else can I do  
Something tells me to  
Give it one more try  
  
I'm not gonna die if love passes me by  
It goes and comes around, I know  
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few  
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do  
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me  
Waiting for the rush to come and find me  
I still remember when love was an angel send  
It will be back again  
  
I can't remember when, I can't remember how  
It's very different now  
It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me  
True to the touch  
I get a rush

Reflections of yesterday's past  
Now headlines and foot lights  
The hours of long nights keep everything  
Moving so fast  
  
It's taken a long time  
And she's walked a thin line  
The fame and fortune arrived  
  
She kept on striving  
Way of surviving  
Till part of those dreams came alive

And she wishes she looks like  
They tell her she looks like all the time  
What she'd give just to feel like  
She tells them she's feeling  
Just fine  
All that money she makes every night  
Ain't as much as it seems  
A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dream  
  
Her heart may be breaking  
But she keeps on taking  
What she thought she wanted way back when  
It's too late to change her  
There's always a stranger  
To tell her she's someone again
